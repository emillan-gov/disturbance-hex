## Overview
[H3](https://h3geo.org/) is an open-source, hexagon-based hierarchical spatial 
index developed by Uber. It provides a powerful way to divide the world into 
grids for spatial analysis, aggregation, and visualization.

H3 is especially useful in geospatial workflows for:
- Spatial binning and heatmaps
- Point clustering
- Spatial joins and indexing
- Resolution-independent analysis
- Overlaying administrative or natural boundaries with consistent hexagons

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features

- **Hexagonal cells**: Better spatial adjacency and equal area than squares.
- **Hierarchical**: 16 levels of resolution (`0` = coarse, `15` = fine).
- **Geospatial operations**: K-rings, polygon filling, neighbor lookup, etc.
- **GeoJSON-friendly**: Easy to integrate with GIS tools.
